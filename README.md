Agent-oriented programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm where the construction of the software is centered on the concept of software agents. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a sub-field of reinforcement learning that focuses on the behavior of multiple learning agents coexisting in a shared environment. Agent-oriented systems are computational frameworks in which autonomous entities—agents—interact, cooperate, and coordinate to achieve individual or collective goals in complex, distributed environments. The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

- __MBSE__: The root folder Arcadia (ARChitecture Analysis and Design Integrated Approach) is a method of tools dedicated to systems engineering and architecture, supported by the Capella modeling tool.    
  - __CAD__: For computer-aided design.
  - __CAM__: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
  - __CAS__: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.
